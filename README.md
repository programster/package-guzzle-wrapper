Guzzle Wrapper
===============
A library that wraps around Guzzle in order to make it easier to send HTTP requests. 
If you need to do anything more complicated, then you can just get the guzzle objects within.

## Testing
Go to the tests folder and run:

```bash
php -S localhost:80 RequestDumper.php
```

Then execute the tests with:
```bash
php main.php
```

This should simply tell you whether each test passed or not.
